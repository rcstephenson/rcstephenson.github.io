### Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers
---

<!-- 
Kinetic Inductance Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPA) are a class of quantum noise limited amplifiers being developed that can produce high signal gain ($\gtrsim$15dB) across wide bandwidths (starting at 4-8GHz range and wider). Such technology has applications where quantam measurements of microwave signals are of interest. Such systems include readout of superconducting-based qubits, and detection of dark matter particles.  

Another application of KI-TWPA amplifiers of interest would be in millimeter wavelength Astronomy. Where Superconducting-Insulator-Superconducting junction are commonly used as microwave mixers (SIS-mixers) for coherent recievers. Such devices are used in telescopes like ALMA and the SMA. The KI-TWPA can compete with SIS-mixers in noise (both being near quantum limited) and can increase upon the operational bandwidths of SIS-mixers. An additional exciting ability made available with KI-TWPAs is the ability to create multi-beam homodyne arrays with the KI-TWPA, which is fabricated with a simple inverted microstrip topology. Negating the need of fabricating and testing thin-barrier junctions.
