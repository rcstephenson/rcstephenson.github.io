### Current Work
---

I work on superconducting parametric amplifiers (paramps) at Caltech and JPL's [Microdevices Lab](https://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/). These devices have the exciting potential of quantum-noise limited performance, with large gain, across large instananeous bandwidths. Applications for paramps include millimeter wavelength Astronomy, circuit-qed experiments, and lab-scale dark-matter searches.
