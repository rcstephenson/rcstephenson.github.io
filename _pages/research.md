### Current Work

I work on superconducting parametric amplifiers (paramps) at Caltech and JPL's Microdevices Lab. These devices have the exciting potential of offering quantum-noise limited performance across large instananeous bandwidths.  Applications for paramps include millimeter wavelength Astronomy, circuit-qed experiments, and lab scale dark matter searches.
